# MIPS_processor_using_VHDL
A 16-bit MIPS processor was implemented using VHDL. It can perform specific tasks according to the instructions written in the instruction rom. It can perform 16 different operation besides 8 different arithmetic operation. Here are some illustrating pictures about the processor design and how it works.
